Hi Maggie,

Our Stata programs are the major source for information on our extracts.

For the CPS, there are two sets of programs. From 1979-1993, we use the
merged outgoing rotation group (MORG) files from the National Bureau of
Economic Research as the underlying data source. The programs for these
years can be found here[1]. From 1994-2014, we use the raw CPS basic
files from the Census Bureau. The programs for these years can be found
here[2]. We hope to upload 2015 CPS data within the next couple weeks.

Our SIPP program files cover the 1990-2008 panels and can be found
here[3]. Some additional information for our SIPP files are
available here[4].

Unfortunately, the two researchers who created the SIPP extracts for
CEPR no longer work here, and none of us who work here have experience
with the SIPP. So, for the time being, we will not be updating our
SIPP extracts.

I hope this is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other
questions.

Best, Cherrie
