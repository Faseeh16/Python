Hi Susan,

Sorry for the late response.

From 2008-present, the ACS does not have a continuous weeks worked
variable so it's not possible to have an exact measure of hourly wages.
Our hourly wage variables are only available from 2005-2007 when the ACS
had a continuous weeks worked variable.

However, if you want an inexact measure, you can assign the middle value
of the weeks worked variable categories and use the formula in
cepr_acs_income.do[1] as a guide to creating an hourly wage variable.
You can find the coding for the weeks worked variable (wkslyr) in
cepr_acs_empstat.do.[2]

Also, make sure you're using the most updated version of our ACS data
(version 1.1.1 was released 19 Sep 2016).
I'm currently working on our next update which will include the 2015
data that was released yesterday.

Best,
Cherrie
