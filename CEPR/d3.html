<p class="blog_text">Which industry you work in has an outsized effect on whether you've seen improvement in living standards during the 21st century, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Since 2000, the increases in workers' ability to purchase goods and services have been unevenly distributed by industry sector. Purchasing power growth, the total change in wages adjusted for inflation, has more than quadrupled for employees in the financial sector and nearly doubled for those providing information services. Meanwhile, the average purchasing power for private sector employees grew only 28.7% during this 17 year period. Employees in the manufacturing and leisure and hospitality sectors saw their purchasing power increase less than 20 percent over the period, while mining and logging sector employees actually saw their ability to buy goods and services fall by 11 percent. </p>
